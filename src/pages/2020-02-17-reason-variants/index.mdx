As you may already know if you read my last post, I have been enjoying writing Reason (also known as ReasonMl) lately. Last time I talked about some of the things which confused me, this time I want to talk about one of my favourite parts of the language, variants and pattern matching.

## What are variants?
Variants are a type in Reason which you may have already encountered in other languages as enums. They are a way of saying that something __is__ a thing of a certain type. I don't think I explained that very well!. You can think of a boolean as a variant because it __is__ either true or false. In the same way a variant __is__ one thing or any number of other things, but it can't be anything else. Let's use an example to dig me out of this semantic hole:

```reason
type season = 
    | Winter 
    | Spring 
    | Summer 
    | Autumn;
```
There are only four seasons and in the same way our `season` variant type can only have the four cases `Winter`, `Spring`, `Summer` or `Autumn`. Notice that the variant cases themselves begin with a capital letter, this is because they are actually constructors and can be called with variables as you would with a function. This means that you can also pass variables around inside your variants like this:

```reason
type temp = float;

type weather = 
    | Snowing 
    | Raining 
    | Windy 
    | Sunny;
    
type season = 
    | Winter(temp, weather) 
    | Spring(temp, weather) 
    | Summer(temp, weather) 
    | Autumn(temp, weather);
```
Here, each of the `season` variants contains two variables, `temp` and `weather`. `temp` is just an alias for float, aliasing is a way of documenting code so that it is easier to convey  intent to anyone reading it in future, the compiler will just see it as a float though. `weather` is another variant; it's possible to pass variants around inside of other variants, they can also be self recursive:

```reason
type things('a) = 
    | Empty 
    | Value('a, things('a));
```
Our type `things` can either be `Empty` or it can contain two values, one is a value of type `'a` which can be any type and the other is another `thing` variant which holds the same type `'a`. This is essentially how Lists work in Reason as you can see if you log one out to the console:

```reason
Js.log(["three", "element", "list]);
```
<CliOutput
  output={`[ 'three', [ 'element', [ 'list', 0 ] ] ]`}
/>
