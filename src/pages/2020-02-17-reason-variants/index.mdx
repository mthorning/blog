## What are variants?
Variants are a type in Reason and, when used with pattern matching, I believe that they are the most powerful feature of the language. They are a way of saying that something *is* a thing of a certain type. I don't think I explained that very well!. You can think of a boolean as a variant because it *is* either true or false. In the same way a variant *is* one thing or any number of other things, but it can't be anything else. Let's use an example:

```reason
type season = | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn;
```

Variants are actually constructors and can be called with variables as you would with a function. This means that you can also pass variables around inside your variants:

```reason
type temp = float;
type weather = | Snowing | Raining | Windy | Sunny;
type season = | Winter(temp, weather) | Spring(temp, weather) | Summer(temp, weather) | Autumn(temp, weather);
```
Here, each of the `season` variants contains two variables, `temp` and `weather`. `temp` is just an alias for float, aliasing is a way of documenting code so that it is easier to convey  intent to anyone reading it in future, the compiler will just see it as a float though. `weather` is another variant; it's possible to pass variants around inside of other variants, they can also be self recursive:

```reason
type things('a) = 
    | Empty 
    | Value('a, things('a));
```
Our type `things` can either be `Empty` or it can contain two values, one is a value
