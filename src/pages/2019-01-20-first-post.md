My name is Matt and I have been working professionally as a JavaScript developer for a little over a year now. In my previous life I was employed as a manager at Royal Mail, but after deciding that I wanted to pursue a more fulfilling career I spent a couple of years teaching myself the basics of web development and was fortunate enough to land a job at a local software development company.

I'm at a point now where I have a good grasp of JavaScript and am learning about how to do some other things such as deploying docker containers, writing bash scripts and even a bit of light white-hat (completely legal!) hacking. As I am locally known for my sieve-like memory I have decided it may be beneficial to start writing some stuff down, and if others can get something from my ramblings then all the better. I'm not sure how many posts I'll manage to write before I get distracted by something new and shiny but let's see how it goes!
