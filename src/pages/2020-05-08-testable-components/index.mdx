Hi. I realise it's been a while. 

I should probably start by saying this isn't going to be a particularly informative article. I haven't put anything out recently for a couple of reasons, one of which is that I haven't been struck with inspiration for subjects to write about, we'll get to the other reason later. 

Yesterday evening I took a look back at some of the posts I've written and saw [this one](/goodbye-windows) which was about moving from Windows to Linux and ends with me stating 
> it's been really enjoyable switching to Linux and I can't see myself moving back to Windows.

I was clearly wrong because I am currently using Windows on both my home and work computers so I thought I could write a quick update.

## My Linux Journey

I didn't stick with Ubuntu for long, I first spent some time using Fedora before moving to Manjaro. Manjaro runs on Arch and I got to really enjoying using the Pacman package manager and the rolling releases which meant I was always using the most up-to-date software. I was never really satisfied with the various desktops I tried so I started looking at window managers. 

After a little while I decided that I really liked the idea of running a computer with no bloat, just the stuff I needed. I decided that I would run Arch with [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) so I ran a couple of trial installs of Arch in Virtualbox before installing it for real.
