My blogs are going to be about different things I have learnt to do by typing words into a computer. It is therefore important that I am able to display these words in my blog posts in a way which is pleasing to the eye.

This site has been created using Gatsby which is a framework which uses GraphQl, React and plugins. This is a test of one of the plugins.

```javascript
const a = 'hello';
const b = 'world';
greet(a, b);

function greet(first, second) {
    console.log(`${first} ${second}`);
}
```
