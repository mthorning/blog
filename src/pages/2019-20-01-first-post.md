I have been working as a JavaScript developer for a little over a year now. In my previous life I was a manager at Royal Mail, but after deciding that I wanted to pursue a more fulfilling career I spent a couple of years learning web development.

I'm at a point now where I have a good grasp of JavaScript and am learning about a number of other technologies. As I am locally known for my sieve-like memory I have decided it may be beneficial to start writing some stuff down, and if others can get something from my scribblings then all the better. I'm not sure how many I'll manage before I see something shiny to chase instead but let's see how it goes!
