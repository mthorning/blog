# Blog website

A blog built using GatsbyJs. Currently titled "Hello Code" and hosted at [blog.thorning.ovh](https://blog.thorning.ovh), this site will contain a mix of articles about computing, mostly JavaScript but will hopefully also contain some more fundamental topics such as linux, networking and security.
